This is a (to do list) project.


What project initially included
---




Changes i want to add

- circular checkbox option at the beginning
- hover effect on the li items (task list)
- hover effect at the cross button
- button to push the task to the todolist box
- if i press enter with empty text then it should not work
- if the task list exceeds then a scroll bar should be added to avoid text outside the box
- store the data after refresh too
